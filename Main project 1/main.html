<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,onvenience: Tistory is an installation blog program called Tattertools that has been moved to a service blog. We set up the server ourselves, imported Tattertools' source code almost as is, targeting general users who had difficulty adapting to Apache web server, MySQL, PHP, etc., and started services like Naver Blog and Daum Blog.
    Subscription type: Tistory uses WYSIWYG (a function that converts what appears on the screen into HTML, also known as WYSIWYG ), so you can use features such as posts, comments, and related posts (trackbacks) even if you do not know how to handle HTML. Therefore, there is also the aspect of a subscription blog.
    Installation type: Unlike other blog services, Tistory allows the use of HTML editing, referrer logs, and visitor records, making it popular among those who are tired of the less free Naver or Daum blogs or advanced users who know how to handle HTML programming. It is possible to create external programs such as skins and plug-ins previously provided by Tattertools. However, for performance reasons, plug-in functions cannot be freely added/edited by users, and service operators selectively install and link them.
